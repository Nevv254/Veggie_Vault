# VeggieVault

**VeggieVault** is a centralized bulk produce marketplace that connects local farmers directly with vendors, restaurants, and retailers.  
Instead of small, unsustainable household deliveries, VeggieVault focuses on **large, wholesale orders**, helping farmers move more produce in fewer transactions and enabling vendors to stock up at competitive prices.

### How It Works
1. **Farmers** list fresh produce in bulk with minimum order quantities (MOQs), prices, and availability.
2. **Vendors** browse listings, compare offers, and place bulk orders for delivery or pickup.
3. **VeggieVault** streamlines logistics, payments, and order tracking for a smoother farm-to-vendor supply chain.

### Why VeggieVault?
- **Efficient** – Fewer deliveries, lower costs, better margins.
- **Sustainable** – Supports local farming communities.
- **Scalable** – Works for fresh produce, grains, dairy, and more.
